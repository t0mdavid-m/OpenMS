@brief Annotates proteoform-spectrum matches (PrSMs) on the raw (centroided, not deconvolved) MS2 spectrum.

The theoretical isotope envelope of every terminal fragment of the proteoform is placed at every plausible charge on
the centroided spectrum, the way ExD Viewer annotates, and kept if it matches:
 - isotope peaks: averagine (FLASHHelperClasses::PrecalculatedAveragine, 25 Da bins) peaks of at least
   min_rel_isotope_intensity of the most abundant one, at mono + k * C13C12_MASSDIFF_U;
 - charges 1 .. min(precursor charge, floor(fragment mass / min_mass_per_charge));
 - each predicted peak is matched to the nearest observed peak within tol ppm (after calibration);
 - an envelope is accepted when at least min_peaks peaks, the most abundant one included, are matched and the cosine and
   the Pearson correlation between predicted and observed intensities (unmatched = 0) pass min_cos and min_pearson.

Blind modifications: a fragment carries a modification mass only if it contains the whole modification range;
fragments that split a range are not annotated.

Calibration (optional): a first pass at calibration_tol over the b/y fragments takes, for every envelope with at least
min_peaks matched peaks, the ppm error of the monoisotopic peak (if kept and matched) or else of the most abundant one;
the median error corrects the observed m/z. Fewer than 5 such envelopes: no correction.

Score: a raw match count grows with the number of fragments tried and with the density of the spectrum. The chance
match rate p0 is therefore measured per PrSM, in its own spectrum, with the same rule and charges on decoy fragment sets
(every target envelope, i.e. its isotope pattern and charges, moved by each of decoy_shifts):
p0 = (decoy matched hypotheses + 1) / (K * n + 2), with K the number of shifts and n the fragment hypotheses. A hypothesis
is an ion type and a length with at least min_peaks predicted isotope peaks and at least one charge whose most abundant
peak falls in the spectrum m/z range; ion types whose masses differ by one to three isotope spacings (z, z+1 and z+2) put
their envelopes on the same peaks and form one hypothesis. A hypothesis counts once, whatever the number of its matched
charges and ion types, and decoys are counted only for the n target hypotheses. With k matched hypotheses,
 - score = -log10 P(X >= k), X ~ Binomial(n, p0): the length enters only through n, so the score does not grow with the
   proteoform length. It is a p-value only as far as the decoy fragments match as often as random fragments do. The
   default shifts are whole multiples of 1.000495 Da, the spacing of the peptide mass bands, so that the decoy masses lie
   in the bands like the masses of random fragments; shifts between the bands underestimate p0;
 - llr = k ln(p1 / p0) + (n - k) ln((1 - p1) / (1 - p0)).
Both are evidence scores of one PrSM in its spectrum, not identification p-values: a candidate selected by a search
(tags, blind modifications) matches more than a random proteoform even when it is wrong. For identification, use
target-decoy competition, e.g. the scores of decoy-protein PrSMs.
