  @page TOPP_FLASHQuantConsensus TOPP_FLASHQuantConsensus

  @brief Quantifies the MS1 features of several runs together: FLASHDeconv features matched across the runs (retention times aligned),
  and every matched feature measured the same way in every run from its raw signal, with match between runs.

  Input: the MS1 mzML files and the FLASHDeconv feature tsv files (-out) of the runs. The retention times of each run are aligned to the
  first run by the features most runs share; features of the same mass (10 ppm, or one isotope apart) and aligned apex (1 min) form a
  consensus feature. A consensus feature detected in at least -min_run_fraction of the runs is measured in every run: the raw mass
  traces at its charges (the median range of its detections) and core isotopes within 10 ppm whose apex lies in its window (the aligned
  apex mapped into the run, +- half its median width), their bulk areas summed. In a run where it was not detected (match between runs),
  its mass is looked for in every MS1 scan of the window with FLASHDeconv's peak group scoring (PeakGroup: raw peaks at its charges +- 2,
  isotope offset search, charge fit, isotope cosine, charge SNR, Qscore; on all peaks of the spectra as read, the noise floored at
  FLASHDeconv's detection limit of the scan: the weakest peak FLASHDeconv keeps), kept if its mass stays within the tolerance of the
  target (or one isotope off), and the scans combined
  as FLASHDeconv combines the scans of a feature (Qscore2D: one minus the lowest product of (1 - Qscore) over consecutive scans, so the
  whole envelope must recur scan after scan). The score of the transfer is that Qscore2D if the mass found (intensity-weighted over the
  scans) lies within three times the median mass error of the detected features of the feature's own mass (measured the same way where
  it was detected; the feature table's mass if no detected run has evidence; FLASHDeconv's tolerance if no feature has evidence in two
  runs where it was detected), and it has a raw abundance; else 0. The null: a decoy mass
  below the envelope by its width + 5.25 isotopes (a shift within the envelope, as in bottom-up, falls on the species' own isotopes; a
  whole number of isotopes below it, on its other forms: oxidized, methylated, ammonia or water lost, all near whole daltons; half an
  isotope off still collects signal; a quarter collects the least), measured and
  scored the same way. The FDR of a score threshold is the number of null scores at or above it over the number of target scores at or
  above it; values whose q-value exceeds -mbr_fdr are NaN. A detected run without raw abundance (no trace in its window) is NaN too.
  Ion mode: that of the features (negative charges: negative mode, m/z = mass / charge - proton mass); the feature files of one call must
  share it. A run with fewer than 3 MS1 spectra has no mass traces: its values are NaN (with a warning).
  Identifications (-in_id, optional): FLASHTnT PrSMs of the runs. A transfer whose run identifies its mass in its window (within three
  times the median mass error of the identifications of the detected features) scores 2, above any Qscore2D (an MS2 identification is
  evidence that FLASHDeconv's MS1 scoring may miss). Its decoy mass is matched the same way and scores 2 when identified, so the
  identifications that fit a mass by chance count as nulls in the FDR like the others. Such a transfer has the status mbr_id; its value
  is as exact as a detected one (PXD042169 SpikeIn, E. coli transfers off by more than 2-fold: mbr_id 2.5%, mbr 19%, detected 11%).
  -mbr_min_score keeps only the mbr transfers of at least that Qscore2D.
